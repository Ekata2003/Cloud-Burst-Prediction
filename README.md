# Cloud Burst Prediction Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Burst Prediction repository! This project aims to predict cloud bursts, also known as heavy rainfall events, using machine learning techniques. Predicting cloud bursts is crucial for early warning systems and disaster preparedness, as it can help mitigate the impacts of these natural disasters.

In this repository, you will find code, data, and resources related to our cloud burst prediction efforts. We have outlined the key sections to help you navigate through this repository effectively.

## Data

The `data` directory contains the datasets used for training and testing our cloud burst prediction models. Please refer to the documentation within the `data` directory for details on the dataset sources and format.

## Preprocessing

The `preprocessing` directory houses the code and scripts used to preprocess the raw data before feeding it into our machine learning models. This step includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation. Detailed instructions on data preprocessing can be found in the `preprocessing` directory.

## Modeling

The `modeling` directory contains code and notebooks related to the development and training of our cloud burst prediction models. We have implemented various machine learning algorithms and models to improve prediction accuracy. You can explore these models and their performance in the `modeling` directory.

## Evaluation

In the `evaluation` directory, you will find tools and scripts for assessing the performance of our cloud burst prediction models. We provide metrics, visualizations, and analysis to help you understand the effectiveness of the models.
